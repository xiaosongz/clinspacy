# clinspacy

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of clinspacy is to perform biomedical named entity recognition, Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concept mapping, and negation detection using the Python spaCy, scispacy, and negspacy packages.

## Installation

You can install the GitHub version of clinspacy with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github('ML4LHS/clinspacy', INSTALL_opts = '--no-multiarch')
```

Note: Python3 is required, if the Python3 is not the **only** version of Python on your system, you might need to manually set which Python to use:

```r 
reticulate::use_python(python = "/bin/python3") # example on Mac
```


## Example

```{r}
library(clinspacy)

clinspacy('This patient has diabetes and CKD stage 3 but no HTN.')
```

## Using the mtsamples dataset

```{r}
data(mtsamples)

str(mtsamples[1:5,])
```


## Binding UMLS Concept Unique Identifiers to a Data Frame

This function binds columns containing concept unique identifiers with which scispacy has 99% confidence of being present with values containing frequencies. Negated concepts, as identified by negspacy's NegEx implementation, are ignored and do not count towards the frequencies.

```{r}
mtsamples_with_cuis = bind_clinspacy(mtsamples[1:5,], text = 'description')

str(mtsamples_with_cuis)
```
